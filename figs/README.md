- Fig1: this shows the axis definition for every cone. regardless of side in the database
Z axis is always towards the tail of the cone. Y axis to the vertical
- Fig2: example of an upsidedown camera facing the cone.
- Fig3: camera axis definition, take note z is into the camera
- Fig4: Robot axis definition, take not z is the vertical axis
- Fig5: suggested mounting position. A and B are accurate and easy planes to measure from.
B is the exact height of the center of the camera lens and A is exactly 13.5cm from it. Use those to have
an easier time 
- Fig6: Shows robot axis and arm axis. They are not always the same. The arm orientation will change
as the robot moves. 
- fig7: shows robot arm during demo. notice that the axis for arm is no longer the same as
robot's axis. This information is not critical unless you are trying to understand
the orientation of the arm. Look into robot.py, getaxis function for more details.
